Yihui Xie’s Bookdown book can answer most of the questions you’ll have. This guide is just a quick start for the specific templates we’re using at UofG Psychology. 0.1 Updating an existing book Download the psyTeachR Bookdown Course Template, unzip it, and copy all the files to your existing project, overwriting any files. Check _index_example.Rmd for anything that might need to be updated in your existing index.Rmd file. "],
["setup.html", "Chapter 1 Setup 1.1 Starting a new book 1.2 Adding chapters 1.3 Adding appendices 1.4 Automatic setup scripts", " Chapter 1 Setup 1.1 Starting a new book 1.1.1 Create a new github repository For psyTeachR courses, the repository should be created by the course lead on the psyTeachR github and have a name structure like this: ug1-practical ug2-practical ug3-stats ug4-dissertation msc-data-skills 1.1.2 Fork the repository Our main course pages are under https://psyteachr.github.io, but you should work on your course page on a forked version in your own github account. On the Code tab of the new repository, click the Fork button. Figure 1.1: Fork a repository from the psyTeachR account If you’re a member of psyTeachR, you’ll get this interface telling you that you’ve already forked this project. You just need to choose your personal account. Figure 1.2: Choose your personal account You’ll see this animation for a few seconds while the repository is being forked to your account. Figure 1.3: Just be patient 1.1.3 Make a new RStudio project Click the green Clone or download button on your personal forked repository and copy the URL (use HTTPS unless you know you’ve set up SSH). Figure 1.4: Find the URL to clone Under the File menu in RStudio, choose New Project... and choose Version Control from the list of options. Figure 1.5: File &gt; New Project… &gt; Version Control Choose Git from the next screen. Figure 1.6: Choose Git Paste the URL you copied from your repository into the Repository URL. Keep the Project directory name the same as the repository name (it should default to this). You can Create the project as a subdirectory anywhere on your computer; I recommend making a directory to keep all your github R projects in. Figure 1.7: Clone your github repository to the RStudio project 1.1.4 Download the template Download the psyTeachR Bookdown Course Template to you computer, unzip it, and move the files into the directory of your new RStudio project. 1.1.5 Edit the template 1.1.5.1 _output.yml Open _output.yml. It should look like this: bookdown::gitbook: default: true smart: false includes: after_body: [include/footer.html, include/webex.js] css: [include/psyteachr.css, include/style.css] config: toc: collapse: section scroll_highlight: yes before: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;Book Template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; after: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;license&quot; href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Creative Commons License&quot; style=&quot;border-width:0&quot; src=&quot;https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://psyteachr.github.io/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;PsyTeachR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; download: [] fontsettings: theme: white family: sans size: 2 sharing: facebook: yes twitter: yes google: no linkedin: no weibo: no instapaper: no vk: no all: [&#39;facebook&#39;, &#39;google&#39;, &#39;twitter&#39;, &#39;linkedin&#39;, &#39;weibo&#39;, &#39;instapaper&#39;] bookdown::pdf_book: includes: in_header: preamble.tex latex_engine: xelatex citation_package: natbib keep_tex: yes Change “Book Template” in the config:toc:before: section to the name of your book. This is the text readers will see at the top of your table of contents that brings them back to the start of the book. Save and close this file. 1.1.5.2 _bookdown.yml Open _bookdown.yml. It should look like this: book_filename: &quot;_main&quot; new_session: yes output_dir: &quot;docs&quot; before_chapter_script: [&quot;R/psyteachr_setup.R&quot;, &quot;R/my_setup.R&quot;] delete_merged_file: true clean: [] language: ui: chapter_name: &quot;Chapter &quot; label: fig: &#39;Figure &#39; tab: &#39;Table &#39; eq: &#39;Equation &#39; thm: &#39;Theorem &#39; lem: &#39;Lemma &#39; cor: &#39;Corollary &#39; prp: &#39;Proposition &#39; cnj: &#39;Conjecture &#39; def: &#39;Definition &#39; exm: &#39;Example &#39; exr: &#39;Exercise &#39; proof: &#39;Proof. &#39; remark: &#39;Remark. &#39; solution: &#39;Solution. &#39; You can change the chapter_name from “Chapter” to “Lab” or something else that makes sense for your course if you want. Leave the labels alone unless you’re translating to another language. Save and close this file. 1.1.5.3 index.Rmd Open _index_example.Rmd. The top YAML header should look like this: --- title: &quot;Template Course&quot; author: &quot;psyTeachR&quot; date: &quot;2019-10-07&quot; site: bookdown::bookdown_site documentclass: book bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib] biblio-style: apalike link-citations: yes description: &quot;This is a template. Use it to start a new course book.&quot; --- Update the title, author, and description strings. For now, don’t change anything in the cite-packages R chunk at the top. This just automatically creates a bibliography file for the specified R packages. Now you can edit the overview. Replace the filler text with a description of your course and fill in the course aims and ILOs. The {-} at the end of the overview title makes sure this chapter isn’t numbered. Save this file with the name index.Rmd. 1.1.6 Render the book Now you’re ready to create the book. Run the following code in the console. bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) You’ll see a lot of text in the console window, which should end in something that looks like: Output created: docs/index.html [1] &quot;/Users/lisad/rproj/psyteachr/book-template/docs/index.html&quot; The last line is the location of your new book. You can copy and paste that in a web browser to view the book. Alternatively, you can open the docs directory in the Files pane of RStudio, click on index.html, and choose View in Web Browser. Figure 1.8: Open your book from the Files pane in RStudio. 1.2 Adding chapters Create new chapters by creating new R Markdown files. Under the File menu in RStudio, choose New File and R Markdown.... Don’t bother adding a title or changing any default settings; the first thing we’ll do is delete all of the content. Figure 1.9: Make a new chapter in a new .Rmd file Name the file with the chapter number and a short title all in lowercase, separated by dashes, like 01-getting-started.Rmd. Chapters will render in alphabetical order by filename (you can specify the order in the yml, but it’s a pain), so all chapters need to start with a number or they’ll end up in the appendix. 1.2.1 Content Start your chapter with a level 1 header. This will be the chapter title. You can then continue to write your chapter in R Markdown. You can refer to any section by it’s label, which is the section title with spaces changed to dashes (e.g., a section called “Your first R Markdown file” can be referenced as #Your-first-R-Markdownfile. You can set a shorter custom label for a section by adding an ID in the format {#rmarkdown}. 1.2.2 Multiple .Rmd files per chapter You can break a chapter up into separate .Rmd files like 01.1-prep, 01.2-in-class, 01.3-homework with a level 1 header only at the start of the first section of the chapter. If you do this, you’ll get the following warning when you render the book; you can just ignore it. Warning message: In split_chapters(output, gitbook_page, number_sections, split_by, : You have 7 Rmd input file(s) but only 6 first-level heading(s). Did you forget first-level headings in certain Rmd files? 1.2.3 Rendering a single chapter After you’ve added several chapters, the whole book might take a long time to render. If you want to quickly check the formatting on a single chapter, use the following code. bookdown::preview_chapter(&quot;02-style-guide.Rmd&quot;) 1.3 Adding appendices Add appendices in the same way as chapters. Just name them following the pattern appendix-a-name.Rmd. The file appendix-0.Rmd just contains the appendix header that groups appendices together (# (APPENDIX) Appendices {-}). You don’t need to edit this, but you can delete this file if you are not going to use appendices. 1.4 Automatic setup scripts Every .Rmd file automatically runs two scripts to load libraries you’ll probably use on every page and set consistent styles for figures across books. The code is located in separate files, so you can make updates in a single place that affect every chapter. If there is a package you’ll need in every chapter, you can create a file called R/my_setup.R. Don’t edit R/psyteachr_setup.R; this file is likely to need periodic updating and it is easier to just replace it than to figure out what changes you made. Any code in R/my_setup.R will be loaded after and overrule code in R/psyteachr_setup.R (e.g., if you want to set a different ggplot theme — but please don’t!). "],
["psyteachr-style-guide.html", "Chapter 2 PsyTeachR Style Guide 2.1 General styles 2.2 Glossary 2.3 Word choice 2.4 Colour 2.5 Figures 2.6 Code chunks 2.7 Call-out Blocks 2.8 References", " Chapter 2 PsyTeachR Style Guide The following are specific recommendations to make our course materials look and act consistently to help students navigate more easily from one year to the next. These styles will be continuously evolving, so do discuss with the team if any recommendations don’t meet your needs or you want to propose new recommendations. 2.1 General styles 2.1.1 Headers Level 1 headers (i.e., chapter titles) should be title case. The first letter of all words should be uppercase except articles, prepositions, and be verbs in the middle of the title (e.g., a, an, the, is, are in, on). Level 2 or higher headings should start with an uppercase letter (unless they are the name of a function or package that starts with a lowercase letter: e.g., tidyverse) and the rest of the heading should be lowercase (except proper nouns: e.g., RStudio, R, psyTeachR, Niamh). You can link to a header using the syntax [link text](#Header-title-with-dashes). If the header title is long, you can make a shorter reference by adding {#shortname} after the header and reference it like [link text](#shortname). You can reference the section by section number this way: \\@ref(shortname) and the number will automatically link to the section (e.g., Section 3.3). Chapters should usually have between three and eight level 2 headers. There will obviously be exceptions, but if you consistently have more or fewer sections, think about restructuring your content. See the section on special headers in the Bookdown book to learn how to divide your book into parts. 2.1.2 Text styles Emphasised text should be bold (e.g., **bold**) Avoid italics and underlining for dyslexia-friendly reading Exactly quoted names of buttons or interface objects should be bold code (e.g., **`bold code`**) Inline code should be in backticks (e.g., `backticks`) Package names should be in backticks (e.g., `tidyverse`) Function names should be in backticks with brackets (e.g., `rnorm()`) 2.1.3 Links Links to pages in the psyteachr site should be normal internal links (e.g., [link text](url). If you are linking to an external resource, use the following style: [link text](url){target=&quot;_blank&quot;} to create a link that looks and behaves like this: RStudio. 2.1.4 Lists Lists where most of the items fit on one line should start each line with an uppercase letter (unless the first word is code where case is important) and there should be no blank lines between items. * Item 1 * Item 2 * Item 3 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 2.1.5 Tables Use knitr::kable() to output tibbles as a table. Set results='asis' in the code chunk header. Set the caption in the caption argument to kable and use \\@ref(tab:chunk-name) to reference the table (e.g., Table 2.1). iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise_all(mean) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits = 3, caption = &quot;Example table with kable.&quot;) Table 2.1: Example table with kable. Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width setosa 5.006 3.428 1.462 0.246 versicolor 5.936 2.770 4.260 1.326 virginica 6.588 2.974 5.552 2.026 If you want to add stripes or fancy styling to your tables, install the package kableExtra (Zhu 2019). This vignette has great examples of other things you can do with table display. iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise_all(mean) %&gt;% knitr::kable(digits = 3, format = &quot;html&quot;, caption = &quot;Example table with kableExtra.&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = &quot;striped&quot;) Table 2.2: Example table with kableExtra. Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width setosa 5.006 3.428 1.462 0.246 versicolor 5.936 2.770 4.260 1.326 virginica 6.588 2.974 5.552 2.026 2.2 Glossary You can use the glossary function to automatically link to a term in the psyTeachR glossary and automatically include a tooltip with a short definition when you hover over the term. Use the following syntax in inline r: glossary(&quot;word&quot;). For example, common data types are integer, double, and character. If you need to link to a definition, but are using a different form of the word, add the display version as the second argument (display). You can also override the automatic short definition by providing your own in the third argument (shortdef). Add the argument link = FALSE if you just want the hover definition and not a link to the psyTeachR glossary. glossary(&quot;data type&quot;, display=&quot;Data Types&quot;, shortdef=&quot;My custom definition of data types&quot;, link = FALSE) [1] “Data Types” You can add a glossary table to the end of a chapter with the following code. It creates a table of all terms used in that chapter previous to the glossary_table() function. ```{r, echo=FALSE, results=‘asis’} glossary_table() ``` term definition character A data type representing strings of text. data-type My custom definition of data types double A data type representing a real decimal number integer A data type representing whole numbers. If you want to contribute to the glossary, fork the github project, add your terms and submit a pull request, or suggest a new term at the issues page. 2.3 Word choice In general, use UK spelling and terminology. Use the colour version of functions in ggplot2. There is a lot of cultural variation in what we call punctuation and symbols. For psyTeachR books, use the conventions in Appendix A. Use the following conventions for proper nouns: RStudio R Markdown (this is how Yihui Xie writes it) LaTeX (you don’t have to be fancy with \\({\\LaTeX}\\)) 2.4 Colour Logo colours are from the University of Glasgow palette. pink: #983E82 orange: #E2A458 yellow: #F5DC70 green: #59935B blue: #467AAC purple: #61589C If you are comfortable editing css and want to add styles with colour, you can add the theme colours to css with the keywords using this pattern: * &lt;span style=&quot;color: var(--purple);&quot;&gt;Some purple text&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span style=&quot;background-color: var(--yellow);&quot;&gt;Yellow background&lt;/span&gt; Remember to test your materials with the Sepia and Night themes. Add additional styles for sepia (div.color-theme-1) and dark (div.color-theme-2) backgrounds. You can also access the psyTeachR colours in R from the function psyteachr_colours() (or psyteachr_colors()). psyteachr_colours() # gives all 6 colours psyteachr_colours(1:3) # specify colours by number c(&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) %&gt;% # specify by name psyteachr_colours() # Lisa loves pipes ## [1] &quot;#983E82&quot; &quot;#E2A458&quot; &quot;#F5DC70&quot; &quot;#59935B&quot; &quot;#467AAC&quot; &quot;#61589C&quot; ## [1] &quot;#983E82&quot; &quot;#E2A458&quot; &quot;#F5DC70&quot; ## [1] &quot;#983E82&quot; &quot;#F5DC70&quot; &quot;#467AAC&quot; tibble( grp = rep(LETTERS[1:6], each = 20), val = rep(1:6, each = 20) + rnorm(20*6) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(grp, val, fill = grp)) + geom_violin() + scale_fill_manual(values = psyteachr_colours()) Figure 2.1: Plot with psyteachr.colours 2.5 Figures Use \\@ref(fig:chunk-name) to link to and reference the figure number in text (e.g., Figure 2.2). You can learn more about including figures and images in the Bookdown book. The chunk label for figures can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). Otherwise, they are not automatically numbered. 2.5.1 R Plots Any graphs should be dynamically created in an R code block. Set echo=FALSE if you don’t want to display the code that creates a plot. Default values are specified below; you don’t have to include those unless you want to change them, but always set the fig.cap. out.width='100%' fig.align='center' fig.width=8 fig.height=5 fig.cap='**CAPTION THIS FIGURE!!**' ```{echo=FALSE, out.width=‘75%’, fig.width=6, fig.height=2.5, fig.cap=‘Dynamically created plot.’} ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm) ``` Figure 2.2: Dynamically created plot. 2.5.2 Images Static images, like screenshots, should be stored in a directory called images and displayed using the knitr::include_graphics function in a code block. ```{r img-psyteacher-logo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=“PsyTeachR Logo”} knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/psyteachr_logo.png&quot;) ``` Figure 2.3: PsyTeachR Logo displayed by the previous code block. 2.5.3 Screenshots You’ll probably want to include some screenshots of RStudio. For consistency, make sure your Rstudio is set to the default editor theme (Modern editor with Text-Mate theme and Consolas font). Set the font size to at least 18 for readability in screenshots. Figure 2.4: Default RStudio editor settings. Keep panes in the default order. Upper left: Source Upper right: Environment, History, Connections, Build, Git Lower right: Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer Lower left: Console Figure 2.5: Default RStudio pane layout. 2.6 Code chunks Always name your code chunks; this makes debugging easier and becomes the name of generated plots. You can duplicate chunk names between .Rmd files, but not within. The chunk label for tables and figures can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). Otherwise, they are not automatically numbered. So just get into the habit of avoiding underscores. 2.6.1 Options Code chunks can take several options The most common ones are explained below. Learn more about code chunks. eval: set to FALSE to skip running the code echo: set to FALSE to skip displaying the code include: set to FALSE to run but show no output (e.g., code, figures, messages, warnings) cache: set to TRUE if you have a code chunk that takes a long time to run. It should run if you make changes, but doesn’t always. Delete your cache and render the book from scratch before you push major updates results “hold” to hold all the output pieces and display them after the code chunk (default for psyTeachR books) “markup” to intersperse code and output as they happen “hide” to hide output “asis” to write raw results (like the output of knitr::kable) 2.6.2 Including headers If you want to show students an example of a code chunk that includes the header, add an option called verbatim to your code chunk and set it equal to what you want displayed inside the curly brackets. Make sure you set eval=FALSE to stop the code chunk from being run. ```{r verbatim-example, eval = FALSE, verbatim = ‘r chunk-name, messages=FALSE’} library(tidyverse) ``` The “verbatim” option is not standard to bookdown. It is only available if you include the code from the “R/psyteachr_setup.R” file. 2.6.3 Verbatim inline backticks Include verbatim inline r like this `r backtick(“r 3+4”)` to produce output like this: `r 3+4`. 2.7 Call-out Blocks The psyTeachR course book style includes four types of call-out blocks that you can use to emphasise text. 2.7.1 Danger ```{block, type=“danger”}Note dangerous things that will break code.``` Note dangerous things that will break code. 2.7.2 Warning ```{block, type=“warning”}Warn readers.``` Warn readers. 2.7.3 Info ```{block, type=“info”}Give further information.``` Give further information. 2.7.4 Try ```{block, type=“try”}Stop and try something.``` Stop and try something. 2.7.5 Code chunks inside call-out blocks If you want to put code blocks inside of a call-out block, you can’t use the syntax above. Start the block with &amp;lt;div class=&quot;danger&quot;&gt; and end it with &amp;lt;/div&gt;. &lt;div class=\"danger\"> Run the code below: ```r # my code ``` &lt;/div> 2.8 References Include references using the bibliography key, such as @R-base, which provides an in-line citation like R Core Team (2019). You can also use square brackets to create a parenthetical citation, like [@R-bookdown] (Xie 2019). You need to add any R packages you want to cite by adding them to the code chunk in the index file and then referencing them by @R-pckgname. # automatically create a bib database for R packages # add any packages you want to cite here knitr::write_bib(c( .packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;tidyverse&#39; ), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) Add other references to the book.bib file using BibTeX format. You can export references from most reference managers in BibTeX format. Learn more about referencing. References "],

If you’re using webex outside of this bookdown template, such as in an rmarkdown webpage, you will need to set the output type to webex::webex_default in the yaml header in order to import the css and javascript files. To create a file from the webex template in RStudio, click File -&gt; New File… -&gt; RMarkdown and in the dialog box that appears, select From Template and choose Web Exercises. 3.1 Fill-In-The-Blanks (fitb()) Create fill-in-the-blank questions using fitb(), providing the answer as the first argument (e.g., fitb(&quot;4&quot;)). 2 + 2 is You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session (e.g., x &lt;- sample(2:8, 1); fitb(x)). The square root of 49 is: The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don’t care about case, use the argument ignore_case = TRUE (e.g., fitb(&quot;E&quot;, ignore_case = TRUE)). What is the letter after D? If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument ignore_ws = TRUE and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable (e.g., fitb(&quot;library( tidyverse )&quot;)). How do you load the tidyverse package? You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector (e.g., fitb(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot; , &quot;U&quot;), ignore_case = TRUE)). Type a vowel: 3.2 Multiple Choice (mcq()) Make a multiple choice question by setting the first argument to mcq() to a vector where the answer(s) are labeled answer (e.g., mcq(c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;3.14&quot;, answer = &quot;42&quot;, &quot;100&quot;, &quot;none of the above&quot;))) “Never gonna give you up, never gonna: let you go turn you down run away let you down” “I bless the rains guess it rains sense the rain down in Africa” “There’s nothing that a hundred men on Mars or more named Marv could ever do” 3.3 True or False (torf()) You can make a quick true-of-false option using torf() (e.g., torf(FALSE)). You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUE FALSE 3.4 Hidden solutions and hints (hide() and unhide()) You can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button using hide() before the solution and unhide() after, each as inline R code. Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the hide() function. If the solution is an RMarkdown code chunk, instead of using hide() and unhide(), simply set the webex.hide chunk option to TRUE, or set it to the string you wish to display on the button.

["inclusion.html", "Chapter 4 Inclusion 4.1 Tips for text-readers 4.2 Dyslexia-friendly resources 4.3 Colour 4.4 Sex, gender and sexuality", " Chapter 4 Inclusion We want our resources to be accessible to everyone. This means thinking about accessibility with regards to disability, language, identity, and other characteristics. This is a work in progress; feel free to suggest additions. 4.1 Tips for text-readers Some students need to use text readers for accessibility; others just prefer this method. Here are some tips for improving their experience from the Dyslexia Style Guide. Use straight quotation marks Avoid roman numerals Avoid text in figures Bookdown books allow readers to change the font style, size, and background colour. This provides essential assessibility for some people, such as those with dyslexia or visual impairments. Therefore, avoid putting too much text in figures and provide descriptions of images in the figure caption. 4.2 Dyslexia-friendly resources British Dyslexia Association Dyslexia Style Guide Some recommendations are highlighted below. Avoid underlining, block capitals, and italics – Use bold instead Use boxes and borders (call-out blocks) for effective emphasis Use left-justified with ragged right edge (don’t full-justify) Use bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose Use the active voice with concise, direct sentences Avoid abbreviations and provide a glossary of jargon 4.3 Colour You can check your images for how they look to people with different types of colourblindness with the Coblis Color Blindness Simulator. Desi Quintans made dark and light colour-blind safe RStudio themes. The “pink” and “green” colours from the psyteachr_colours() function are distinguishable by people with protanopia (red-blind), deuteronopia (green-blind), and tritanopia (blue-blind) colourblindness. You can also use viridis colours with ggplot2::scale_colour_viridis_d() and ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_d() (for discrete colours) or ggplot2::scale_colour_viridis_c() and ggplot2::scale_fill_viridis_c() (for continuous colours). In plots, add secondary indicators in addition to colour, such as text labels or shapes. Figure 4.1: Text labels supplement colour information. Figure 4.2: Facet labels and redundant colour information. Figure 4.3: Supplement point colours with shapes. 4.4 Sex, gender and sexuality When teaching about experimental design, sex always used to be my go-to example of a two-level between-subjects factor. But this can make some people feel like their very existence is being ignored. In your examples, avoid implicitly assuming heterosexuality or binary gender. If you want to suggest an in-class exercise that uses data from the students, make sure to choose something that doesn’t exclude anyone.
